    Assume that we change the CreditCard class (see Code Fragment 1.5) so that
    instance variable balance has private visibility.
    Why is the following implementation of the PredatoryCreditCard.charge method
    flawed? public boolean charge(double price) {
        boolean isSuccess = super.charge(price);
        if (!isSuccess)
            super.charge(5); // the penalty
        return isSuccess;
